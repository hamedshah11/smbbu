-- Assign faculty-level departments and missing institute links for the rows
-- migration 0003 left department-less. Rows are addressed by sort_order, which
-- generate.mjs assigned as the 1-based index over migration-input/faculty.json;
-- the lists below are emitted by scripts/migrate/assign-faculty-departments.mjs
-- from that same file. Null-guards keep the migration from overwriting values
-- an admin has filled in since. department_slug is generated from department
-- (0003), so it follows automatically. The 93 "Introduction" rows are left
-- untouched; see scripts/migrate/introduction-review.csv.
